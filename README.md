Chap 4 python fundamentals

**Thoughts:**  
Thinking about a deferent method for the hookfile.py script.  
Use a simple config file that is read by the script with only the 
basic info (variable info) for each antlet. Then hookfiles are recreated from the config file.

**Thoughts:**  
I keep coming up with new things that must be checked!
- can't have duplicate host ports
- adding ports for an antlet already in the hooks file
- removing a port#
- removing all for an antlet
