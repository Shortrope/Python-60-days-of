## Day 17: October 29, 2018 - 1.5hr
**Today's Progress:**  
Chap 4 python fundamentals

**Thoughts:**  
Thinking about a deferent method for the hookfile.py script.  
Use a simple config file that is read by the script with only the 
basic info (variable info) for each antlet. Then hookfiles are recreated from the config file.

hook-file.py:

**Thoughts:**  
I keep coming up with new things that must be checked!
